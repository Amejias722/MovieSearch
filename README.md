### Movie search requirements
- As a user, I am able to search for a movie using a phrase such as "Legally Blonde" or "Star Wars".
- The search result should show me the following information:
    - The full title
    - The first 50 words of the description
    - The rating of the movie and the number of raters
    - The release date in the format "month day, year" (i.e. Feb 01, 2022).
    - The poster of the movie.
- If the results have additional pages, I want to have a mechanism to view the additional results (20 per page).
- I want to be able to share my search results with others by sharing the URL to it. In other words, make sure that
the query parameters are in sync with the search query/results on the page.
